Scratch for Holiday
===================

Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) is a graphical programming language designed to teach children the fundamentals of coding and computer science.

Scratch 2.0, released in 2013, introduced the capability for 'Extensions' - blocks that can interact with Scratch.

Scratch for Holiday is an implementation of a Scratch extention that allows Scratch to control Holiday by MooresCloud (holiday.moorescloud.com).

It's still very early days with this code - it barely works, and has uncovered a few bugs in Scratch - but the goal is to make Holiday programming as easy in Scratch as moving a sprite.

Usage
-----

* From a command line within the directory, type "python scratch.py ip-address-of-holiday" 
* If you don't know the IP address of your Holiday, use the Holiday Finder for Chrome Desktop tool to discover it.
* Once Scratch for Holiday has started up, launch the offline version of Scratch 2.0 (linky goes here)
* While holding the shift key down, select Scratch's "File" menu, and select "Import Experimental Extension"
* When the file dialog appears, select the file "holiday.2se"
* You will now see a number of new blocks appear in the "More Blocks" tab.
* You can use these new blocks in your Scratch programs (a manual will follow later)
* It seems that Scratch wants to be restarted every time a change is made in the program.  Which sucks, but forewarned is forearmed.
* Make a change to your code, save it out, then relaunch Scratch, Import the Experimental Extention, load your program again, and go.  (Yes incredibly ugly but seems to work.)

Happy Holidays!
